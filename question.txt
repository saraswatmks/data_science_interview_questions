Question &gt; Data Analysis [Cleaning/Basic Analysis of Data]:

- Download the zip file containing customer basic info and event logs
- Files
- uicycles - contains the install-uninstall events for customers
- eventdump - contains event triggered within the app for customers
- Info:
- Customer information contains install-uninstall-reinstall cycles in vertical
format [ ~170k records] [so for a customer 1 lifetime cycle is a single install-uninstall
event set or a reintall-uninstall event set] [so if a customer install-uninstalls-reinstalls-
uninstalls then he has 2 life cycles within the app which need to be treated
separately]
- Event logs contain the events triggered within the app by these customers [
~1 million records]
- Generate the following from the data provided [Analysis questions below are along
the lines of CLTV(Customer Lifetime Value) analysis]
- Customer retention trends from their lifetime cycles [frequency chart or
histogram plot] [retention is defined as the duration of one install-uninstall cycle, so
multiple re-installs have to be treated separately]
- Find out the time of day when the customers are most active [use your own
discretion for time of day bucketing] [activity is defined on the basis of events]
- Purchase value buckets [find purchase/checkout events from event logs and
parse the &#39;properties&#39; column to get total value associated and generate a simple
bucketed frequency chart/histogram plot]
- Behavior of purchasing and non-purchasing customers [something along the
lines of their in-app event frequency in a given install-uninstall cycle]
- Week over Week revenue trends for purchasing customers
- How are their purchases distributed post install? [the number and

value of purchases after installing the app in one retention cycle]

- Do they perform purchases in the 2nd,3rd etc weeks post install? [if

their retention cycle is greater than 1 week]

- Is there a steady inflow of revenue for customers with high retention?

[growth can decline but is it still a positive gradient?]
- Any other actionable insights that can be drawn from the given data?
